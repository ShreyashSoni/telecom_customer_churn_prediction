# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Customer retention has become more important than customer acquisition. 
This project involved predicting which customers are at high risk of churn for a telecom company. 
Built two classification models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest and selected the most significant indicators for customer churn. 
Extensive data exploration and feature engineering was performed to produce better features for classification.
